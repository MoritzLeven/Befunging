# Befunging
Some (probabilistic) programs in <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" target="_blank">Befunge-98</a> (use, e.g., this <a href="https://purkka.codes/jsfunge-98/befunge98.html" target="_blank">interpreter</a> to execute the programs).
Make sure you view program files using a monospace font, otherwise Befunge programs are hard to read ...

# Plans for the future
- maybe some useful stuff like probabilistic quicksort ...
