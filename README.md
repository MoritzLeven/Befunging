# Befunging
Some (probabilistic) programs in [Befunge-98](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge){:target="_blank"} (use, e.g., this [interpreter](https://purkka.codes/jsfunge-98/befunge98.html){:target="_blank"} to execute the programs).
Make sure you view program files using a monospace font, otherwise Befunge programs are hard to read ...

# Plans for the future
- maybe some useful stuff like probabilistic quicksort ...
